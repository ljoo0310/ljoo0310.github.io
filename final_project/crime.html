								<h2>"Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep, and you weep alone."</h2>
							</header>
							<p>An average salaryman, Oh Dae-su, is a married man with a young cute daughter. But one
								day on his way back home drunk, he gets kidnapped. He wakes up locked away in a window-less
								room with just a bed, a bathroom, and a TV. With no clue of his imprisonment, he spends 15 years
								watching the world change through a TV screen. Just as sudden as his kidnapping was, he suddenly
								becomes free one day. A friendly young sushi restaurant owner, Mi-do, takes care of him and helps
								him on his investigation of the reason of his imprisonment and his revenge. </p>
							<br>
							<p>Undoubtedly a Korean classic, 'Oldboy' was highly recognized for its well-making. An American
							  remake of it was also released in 2013 starring Spike Lee. It was also one of the movies that my
								Korean Cinema class professor had us study. The camera scenes, themes, and plot are all amazing.
								I too joined on Dae-su's investigation of the truth, wondering just why was this seemingly average
								guy locked up for a staggering 15 years, and why 15? Anything beyond this would be a spoiler. The
								film reaches its climax as the truth is unraveled at the end, which left me with my jaw dropped
								open for quite a long time. Oldboy is must-watch Korean movie for sure.</p>

								</header>
								<p>Lee Ja-sung is an undercover cop in Korea's greatest criminal organization, "Gold Moon,"
									as he was ordered to do so by his investigation team chief, Mr. Kang. It's been 8 years
									and Ja-sung rose up high in ranks, all the way to becoming the right-hand man of "Jung Chung,"
									the 2nd in line of Gold Moon. But as the organization's president suddenly becomes dead, the
									organization becomes busy seeking for the next heir. At the same time, the police force, mainly
									Mr. Kang sees this as an opportunity to take over the organization, thus naming the operation as
									"New World." Ja-sung is now pressured to take orders from his chief who sometimes pushes him too
									far, and is now in a dilemma of becoming too attached to, almost like brothers with Chung. He
									has to pick a side as he can no longer can stand foot within both parties.</p>
								<br>
								<p>When the movie came out, a saying was created that went, "you're not a man if you haven't watched
									'New World' yet." It instantly became popular among men as the theme of rising to power was probably
									strongly appealing. The constant conflicts between orders from the police force and from Gold Moon
									keeps up the pace throughout the entire runtime, and  how Ja-sung changes as he makes important
									decisions is also very interesting to watch. Along with that, Hwang Jung-min, the actor of Jung Chung,
									was incredible with his acting. The jolly gangster charcter he created gave a very strong impression,
									and it blended with his appearance and actions so nicely. Although crime films may tend to get a bit
									boring mid-way, this one was definitely fun to watch the whole time.</p>

									<h2>"When you become insanely obsessed over one person, you get this kind of strange and
										inexplicable faith..."</h2>
								</header>
								<p>After a mysterious explosion accident, abandoned members of Asia's greatest drug group Oh Yeon-ok
									and Laak come to Won-ho who has been investigating on this group for a long time. With their help,
									he finds clues and comes closer to finding the head of this group, alternatively known as Mr. Lee.
									No one knows who he is, what's his real name, and how he looks like. But now it seems like that's
									about to change. By intercepting illegal trades and tracking down their activities, Won-ho gets
									warm on discovering the identity of Mr. Lee, but the gang members don't let that happen so easily.
									His life is on the line and he knows it, but nothing can stop his drive to do so.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Compared to the two movies above, this one is a bit lacking in the story plot as it's a bit cliche
									of what is going on. But nonetheless, the lineup of renowned actors and the new realistic investiagtion
									methods they use makes the movie more interesting to watch. For this one, there's the on-going question
									of "who is Mr. Lee?" to keep the audience stay focused. If you're smart enough, you may figure it out
									before the end of the movie. I suspected the right guy about two-thirds into the movie. Let's see if
									you can do better.</p>
