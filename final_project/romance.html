												<h2>"I remember what we ate together, where we went together, and even the side dishses that were there

											</header>
											<p>Woo-jin is a very special man, perhaps a bit unfortunate too. Every day when he wakes up and looks into
												the mirror, he finds himself as a completely different person. Sometimes he's a young boy, an old grandma,
												or even a mature woman. There's no clue to who he'll be tomorrow. But he comes across the woman of his life,
												Yi-soo and determines to tell her his one greatest secret. It's an all-dreams-come-true when she agrees to
												go out with him, but Yi-soo soon finds herself in a dilemma where she can't recognize who Woo-jin is. It's
												saddenning to her because every time, it's as if she's meeting someone new all over again. Some people say
												that not that many things matter when it comes to love but when considering a changing face? Well...let's
												see how these guys handle it.</p>
											<br>
											<p>Even though including the bizzare idea of having a different face, a different body every day into a romance
												movie, Beauty Inside does a great job in making this seem natural and merely a factor in having a relationship,
												like having different personalities or something. And it's entertaining to see how a single person, Woo-jin is
												acted out by a myriad of actors, even Japanese and women too. It's touching to see the efforts Woo-jin and
												Yi-soo each make for each other, and is saddenning to see when they don't work out as hoped. But still, that
												doesn't stop them from following their hearts.</p>

											<p>Seung-min is a new freshie at college just beginning his first class, Architecture 101. But in
												class, he sees Seo-yeon whom he instantly begins to have a crush on. They coincidentally end up
												workign on the same assignment together and get closer, but Seung-min is too shy to make a move
												to express even the slightest bit of his feelings for her. Eventually, a misunderstaning occurs
												between the two which makes Seung-min to put his feelings aside. But 15 years later, once again
												by coincidence, Seung-min is called to build a house for someone who turns out to be Seo-yeon.
												As she explains her ideas and he designs them, they begin to recall the past and begin to form
												somewhat of a feeling, but what happens at the end is up to you to see.</p>
											<br>
											<p>Honestly, I watched this movie because it starred my favorite celebrity at the time, Suzy. She's
												really pretty throughout the entire movie (no wonder why Seung-min falls in love for her). But
												personal thoughts aside, her image perfectly match what we would recall as our first crush. A really
												pretty girl who's outgoing, popular, doesn't seem to care much about what's around her, and a girl we're
												too shy to appraoch first. Architecture 101 really touches upon the feelings of having a first crush
												and everyone who watches it would have some memory to look back upon. First crushes don't always work
												out, but they surely leave an intense memory which we all keep throughout our lives.</p>

											<h2>"Laugh and the world laughs with you. Weep, and you weep alone."</h2>
										</header>
										<p>An average salaryman, Oh Dae-su, is a married man with a young cute daughter. But one
										day on his way back home drunk, he gets kidnapped. He wakes up locked away in a window-less
										room with just a bed, a bathroom, and a TV. With no clue of his imprisonment, he spends 15 years
										watching the world change through a TV screen. Just as sudden as his kidnapping was, he suddenly
										becomes free one day. A friendly young sushi restaurant owner, Mi-do, takes care of him and helps
										him on his investigation of the reason of his imprisonment and his revenge. </p>
										<p>Undoubtedly a Korean classic, 'Oldboy' was highly recognized for its well-making. An American
										remake of it was also released in 2013 starring Spike Lee. It was also one of the movies that my
										Korean Cinema class professor had us study. The camera scenes, themes, and plot are all amazing.
										I too joined on Dae-su's investigation of the truth, wondering just why was this seemingly average
										guy locked up for a staggering 15 years, and why 15? Anything beyond this would be a spoiler. The
										film reaches its climax as the truth is unraveled at the end, which left me with my jaw dropped
										open for quite a long time. Oldboy is must-watch Korean movie for sure.</p>
