												<h2>"Only I came back without having found anything."</h2>
											</header>
											<p>Studies, dating, job-hunting, nothing works out for Hye-won as she lives her busy city life.
												After much exhaustion, she decides to go back home in the country side where she meets her
												old friends, Jae-ha and Eun-suk. It was an impuslive decision, to go back home as if running
												away from the reality facing her in Seoul. Not sure what to do with her life, she spends time
												with Jae-ha, who also came back from the city but with determination to live a farming life to
												do what he truly enjoys, and Eun-suk, who is working at the local bank and is satisfied with a
												stable job. Getting her mind off of everything, she relaxes in nature and reflects much upon
												herself. As she spends a special year there and finally it's spring again, she makes her first
												step to a new chapter of her life.</p>
											<br>
											<p>This film is based on the original movie "Little Forest: Four Seasons" which was made in Japan.
												I personally haven't watched the Japaneese version yet, but I enjoyed this one as it reflected well
												of what many Korean young adults worry today: what on earth to do with our lives. Getting a job is
												harder than ever before, and it seems we're living meaningless lives. Little Forest gives us a nice
												break from our stressful and busy workalholic lives and have us think about ourselves deeply once
												more. Plus, the food taht Hye-won cooks look absolutely delicious, so make sure you have a full
												stomach before watching or plan a big meal ahead afterwards.</p>

											<p>Man-sup has just came back to college at 24-years old, sucks at studying, and is
												unpopular among girls. And when everyoen else is busy studying for entrance exams,
												all he thinks about is the hottest girl on campus and how he wants to play Jokgu.
												Almost everyone avoids him at first as they don't want to get involved with him. But
												as the school decides to demolish the Jokgu field, he goes on protest and does his
												best to bring back Jokgu into his campus. Gradually, some people follow along as they
												desire to get away from the stress of studying, and soon enough, everyone becomes a fan
												of Jokgu and Man-sup is famous as the guy who brought it back. There's no mateiral reward
												in succeeding to keeping the Jokgu field in place but to Man-sup, that's not the thing that
												matters.</p>
											<br>
											<p>First off, Jokgu is a mix of soccer and volley ball. You basically play volley ball but you
												only use your feet to pass and spike the ball. It's a relatively popular sport among guys in
												Korea, but is less appealing to women who'd mostly rather prefer soccer. So Man-sup is the guy
												who's going against social conventions and even I wouldn't want to be where he is. I'm a realistic
												kind of guy so I can't deny the importance of studying at college. But to see how Man-sup never
												get discouraged by what others say and is adamant in achieving what he wants was really quite inpiring.
												He's a fool in the movie, but perhaps it's fools who are the ones who can do more than the ordinary.

											<h2>"Why should I be gone? I'm here, right now, but why should I be gone?!?"</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Nam Hyun-soo is a well-going celebrity, was popular among teens in back in the days and
											now in his 30's he's the nuumber #1 radio DJ with a renowned reputation. Everything in his life
											seems perfect until one day, he gets a story on broadcast about someone looking for her father.
											He encouraged her to go find him but then suddenly, a girl (Hwang Jung-nam) and a young boy come up
											to his apartment, saying that she's his daughter and he's his grandchild. Apparently, he had her when
											he was just a teen and now his daughter too gave birth to a boy when she was a teen. His manager warns
											him that celebrities who had scandals go down the drain without doubt, so he tries to avoid her. But
											Jung-nam, having sought for her dad for so long is not a quitter. However, eventually social media
											catches on and Hyun-soo is on the risk of losing all of his reputation. He's in real trouble.</p>
										<br>
										<p>Although not exactly the most relatable story, it's nonetheless a realistic one so it's not entirely
											strange to the audience. And the little boy is just too cute not to watch. Stepping back from the
											twisted movie plot, the film throws us the question of which matters more, your career or your family.
											The answer should be obvious to most of us but I'm not sure how many of us will think the same when
											that family suddenly comes out of nowhere after more than a decade has past. Hyun-soo struggles with this
											question as he surely has a lot to lose. As to what he decides upon, I'll leave that up to you to figure
											out.
