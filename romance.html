												<h2>"I remember what we ate together, where we went together, and even the side dishses that were there

											<p>Woo-jin is a very special man, perhaps a bit unfortunate too. Every day when he wakes up and looks into
												the mirror, he finds himself as a completely different person. Sometimes he's a young boy, an old grandma,
												or even a mature woman. There's no clue to who he'll be tomorrow. But he comes across the woman of his life,
												Yi-soo and determines to tell her his one greatest secret. It's an all-dreams-come-true when she agrees to
												go out with him, but Yi-soo soon finds herself in a dilemma where she can't recognize who Woo-jin is. It's
												saddenning to her because every time, it's as if she's meeting someone new all over again. Some people say
												that not that many things matter when it comes to love but when considering a changing face? Well...let's
												see how these guys handle it.</p>
											<br>
											<p>Even though including the bizzare idea of having a different face, a different body every day into a romance
												movie, Beauty Inside does a great job in making this seem natural and merely a factor in having a relationship,
												like having different personalities or something. And it's entertaining to see how a single person, Woo-jin is
												acted out by a myriad of actors, even Japanese and women too. It's touching to see the efforts Woo-jin and
												Yi-soo each make for each other, and is saddenning to see when they don't work out as hoped. But still, that
												doesn't stop them from following their hearts.</p>

											<p>Seung-min is a new freshie at college just beginning his first class, Architecture 101. But in
												class, he sees Seo-yeon whom he instantly begins to have a crush on. They coincidentally end up
												workign on the same assignment together and get closer, but Seung-min is too shy to make a move
												to express even the slightest bit of his feelings for her. Eventually, a misunderstaning occurs
												between the two which makes Seung-min to put his feelings aside. But 15 years later, once again
												by coincidence, Seung-min is called to build a house for someone who turns out to be Seo-yeon.
												As she explains her ideas and he designs them, they begin to recall the past and begin to form
												somewhat of a feeling, but what happens at the end is up to you to see.</p>
											<br>
											<p>Honestly, I watched this movie because it starred my favorite celebrity at the time, Suzy. She's
												really pretty throughout the entire movie (no wonder why Seung-min falls in love for her). But
												personal thoughts aside, her image perfectly match what we would recall as our first crush. A really
												pretty girl who's outgoing, popular, doesn't seem to care much about what's around her, and a girl we're
												too shy to appraoch first. Architecture 101 really touches upon the feelings of having a first crush
												and everyone who watches it would have some memory to look back upon. First crushes don't always work
												out, but they surely leave an intense memory which we all keep throughout our lives.</p>

											<h2>"I think there's a huge misunderstanding, but I'm following you becuase I like you."</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Kang-il is a fire-fighter who risks his life whenever there's a fire but keeps the internal scars
											of failing to save his wife. Whereas Mi-soo is doctor who doesn't care at all about what other people
											tell her and acts as if she doesn't get hurt or love at all, but now she's in a risky position which
											may cost her career just because of one small mistake. By chance, Mi-soo begins to work as a fire-fighter
											assistant and gets to meet Kang-il and open her heart to him for the first time in her life. She doesn't
											hide any of her feelings and Kang-il slowly opens his heart too after a long while in loneliness. But each
											of them has his/her own hurtings which needs attending to, but both of them fail to take care of themselves.
											Will they be able to fill in the gaps for each other and make the wounds heal?</p>
										<br>
										<p>Love 911 is an intersting love story between a fire-fighter and a doctor. As a guy, it was very fun to
											watch a very outgoing and active female leading role because typically Korean female characters in dramas are
											often shy so the guy approaches her first. So it was entertaining to see how Kang-il acts coldly and ignores
											her at first but Mi-soo keeps on trying to win his heart. Although I can't relate much, Kang-il's character
											made me think about the question "when is it okay for us to move on?" I never been through marriage yet but
											perhaps a sad breakup may be more relatable. I don't know what's the right answer, but at least this movie
											shows a good example of how it can work out well.</p>
