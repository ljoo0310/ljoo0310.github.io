Physical Properties of Minerals

There are approximately 4000 different minerals, and each of those minerals has a unique set of physical properties. These include: 
color, 
streak, 
hardness, 
luster, 
specific gravity, 
cleavage, 
fracture, 
and many more. 
These physical properties are useful for identifying minerals. However, they are much more important in determining the potential industrial uses of the mineral.
