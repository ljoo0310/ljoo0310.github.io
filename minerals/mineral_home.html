  <p>What are Minerals?</p>
  <p>
    To meet the definition of "mineral" used by most geologists, a substance
    must meet five requirements:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>naturally occurring</li>
    <li>inorganic</li>
    <li>solid</li>
    <li>definite chemical composition</li>
    <li>ordered internal structure</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    "Naturally occurring" means that people did not make it. Steel is not a
    mineral because it is an alloy produced by people. "Inorganic" means that
    the substance is not made by an organism. Wood and pearls are made by
    organisms and thus are not minerals. "Solid" means that it is not a liquid
    or a gas at standard temperature and pressure. "Definite chemical
    composition" means that all occurrences of that mineral have a chemical
    composition that varies within a specific limited range. For example:
    the mineral halite (known as "rock salt" when it is mined) has a chemical
    composition of NaCl. It is made up of an equal number of atoms of sodium and
    chlorine.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Ordered internal structure" means that the atoms in a mineral are arranged
    in a systematic and repeating pattern. The structure of the mineral halite
    is shown in the illustration on this page. Halite is composed of an equal
    ratio of sodium and chlorine atoms arranged in a cubic pattern.
