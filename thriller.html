												<h2>"For those whole are still alive, I wish you good luck."</h2>
											</header>
											<p>Seuk-woo boards on a train with his daughter to go see her mother, whom he's in a
												complicated reltionship with right now. But little did they know that a zombie virus outbreak just
												began in Seoul...Starting from one passenger, to a train assistant, people began going mad and biting
												each other and soon enough, the survivors become cornered. Outside is already chaos so the train
												conductor makes the decision to go all the way to Busan, the final stop. But with everyone's life on
												the line, selfish people become more selfish, abondoning those if it seems too risky to save them.
												But Seuk-woo and a handful of others are the brave and good-hearted who risk their own lives to save
												others. They don't know whether people or zombies will be waiting for them at Busan, but either way,
												everyone is struggling to stay alive.</p>
											<br>
											<p>The Train to Busan got a lot of media attention at the time it was released because it's very rare to
												see a Korean movie on a zombie apocalypse, not to mention the famous actors. However, compared to other
												zombie movies, it was a little bit lacking because I couldn't find anything else knew. But consdiering
												that it's one of the first for a Korean movie, I'd say it was a somewhat of a success. It did feel a
												bit strange to see zombies running around in a Korean setting. I hope movie directors will keep on
												continuing to make movies like this.

											</header>
											<p>Su-hyun who is an officer at the Secret Service loses his fiance from a cruel murder.
												He later finds out that Jang Gyung-chul is the mad murderer and filled with hatred and
												vengeance, he seeks to take his revenge on him. Su-hyun follows him and beats him up
												just before the brink of death so that he doesn't die off and can feel the pain. But
												Gyung-chul begins to enjoy such a comeback that he never faced before and here begins
												a battle of vengeance and cruelty between two mad men.</p>
											<br>
											<p>I was surprsied after watching this movie as I never expected that such cruel and intense
												movie could be made and released in Korea. The actor's acting were so realistic that I
												thought that this would exactly be what men filled with vengeance would look like. I could
												totally tell why each man was becoming more and more infuriated with anger and madness,
												but still, to fully act upon it...I'm not sure if I could even get as close (which is
												probably a good thing). If you wonder what true hatred and revenge would look like, I would
												definitely recommend this movie.</p>
