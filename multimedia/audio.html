    My favorite movie is "About Time" which was directed by Richard Curtis and
    released in 2013. I have a lot of reasons on why I love this movie the most.
    One of them is that the movie contains such a variety of genres. It has
    romance, family, comedy, drama, and even fantasy. Even though this is quite
    a handful, the movie blends these so fluidly with the story of a man who can
    travel back in time and uses this ability to pursue his own happiness,
    mainly love.
  </p>
  <p>
    The movie flows rather smoothly which makes it easier for the
    viewer to also be immersed in the gentle heartwarming scenes that appear
    across the film. Everything in the movie isn’t specifically fancy nor
    spectacular, but is plain to just the right degree that one can also enjoy
    the happiness that emerges as the story progresses on.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I mentioned earlier, one of the themes of the movie is time travel which
    I am a huge fan of. Other films would portray time travel as a chance to
    change history or have a glimpse of the future, but this movie focuses on
    one’s own life of how one can fix one’s mistakes and regrets.
  </p>
  <p>
    This all adds up to the moral of the movie which is ironically that we don’t
    need to be able to travel in time. To live your life with the least regrets,
    you simply have to live to your fullest at every moment of your life as
    every moment is special.
